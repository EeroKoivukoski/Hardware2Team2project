# Heart Rate Measurement System

This project is a heart rate and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) analysis system based on a **Raspberry Pi** computer and a **Pico** board. The system is standalone and designed to measure heart rate in real time and provide basic HRV analysis.

## Project Description

In this project, a heart rate measurement device has been developed that uses optical heart rate sensing technology (PPG) to measure the user's heart rate and perform HRV analysis. The data is displayed on an OLED screen, and the device can also send data to a Raspberry Pi over MQTT protocol.

### Key Features:
1. **Heart Rate Measurement:** Displays heart rate in real time.
2. **HRV Analysis:** Calculates values like average heart rate, RMSSD, SDNN, and PPI, and displays them on the OLED screen.
3. **Wi-Fi and MQTT Integration:** The device connects to Wi-Fi and sends measurement data to a Raspberry Pi-based client via MQTT protocol.
4. **Kubios Cloud Integration:** Sends data to Kubios Cloud for further deep analysis.
